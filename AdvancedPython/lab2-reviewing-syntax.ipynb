    "## Goals\n",
    "Welcome to your second lab day! \n",
    "The primary goal of this lab is to make sure that you master basic python syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of what we'll see during this lab is things you're already somewhat familiar with. As a consequence, many of the exercises are about correcting faulty syntax. Tracking and correcting buggy code, be it syntactically wrong or semantically faulty, is a major part of day-to-day programming. Better get you used to it!\n",
    "**Tip:** _Don't hesitate to open up previous class materials and refer to them, as it might prove helpful._\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** At the end of the lab are two exercises that you are expected to submit for grading on Arche. You will have until 9:59am on Friday, 6th October (just before our next lab) to submit. You will find the submission instructions at the end of this notebook."

    "Typically, in python, we use the keyword `if`, followed by a condition (anything that can be evaluated as `True` or `False`) and a colon (`:`) for that purpose. Instructions that are to be conditionally executed are to be indented. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if number_of_peanuts_i_have > 42:\n",
    "    give_peanuts_to_everyone()\n",

    "\n",
    "In case you want to define a behavior if the condition fails, use the `else` keyword:\n",

    "\n",
    "The second means of looping over instructions is called a `for` loop. It iterates over each element in a collection, for instance, items in a list, or characters in a string), and stops when there are no more. Each element, in turn, is stored in the variable declared right after the `for` keyword. We put the collection after an `in` keyword. For example:\n",

    "The *Collatz sequence* is an iterative sequence defined on the positive integers by:\n",

    "n -> n / 2    if n is even\n",
    "n -> 3n + 1   if n is odd\n",

    "13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1\n",

    "### Exercise 1\n",
