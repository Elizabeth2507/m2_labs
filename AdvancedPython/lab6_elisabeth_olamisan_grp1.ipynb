Submit either a `.py` or an `.ipynb` file containing the exercises and name it `td6_firstname_lastname_grpN.py` or `td6_firstname_lastname_grpN.ipynb` accordingly, where `firstname` should be your first name, `lastname` should be your last name, and `N` in `grpN` should be your group number (e.g. Jane Doe, who is in group A1, should name her submission either `td6_jane_doe_grp1.py` or `td6_jane_doe_grp1.ipynb`, depending on whether Jane submitted a Python script or a Jupyter notebook).\n",
