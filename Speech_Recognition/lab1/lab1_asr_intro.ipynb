    "\n",
    "This lab is an introduction to automatic speech recognition (ASR). In a nutshell, the ASR process consists of the following blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature extraction**: The audio waveform is preprocessed into normalized features such as spectrogram or MFCCs.\n",
    "2. **Acoustic model**: The features are transformed into high-dimensional embeddings via a deep neural network (here: [wav2vec2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11477)), and then a classifier is applied to predict the class of each token (=character) at each time step.\n",
    "3. **Decoding**: A transcript is generated from the sequence of class probabilities, either using a language model or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-to-build-domain-specific-automatic-speech-recognition-models-on-gpus/\">\n",

    "    \n",
    "In this lab, we experiment with ASR using pretrained acoustic models (which include feature extraction for simplicity). We provide a dataset of real-life speech audio (with trancription) in order to study the influence of several factors onto the performance of a modern ASR system. We focus on the usage of the acoustic model, thus we use a simple decoder with no language model (this will be the topic of the next lab).\n",
    "\n",
    "This series of lab relies on [torchaudio](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/index.html), which is a pytorch-based librairy for audio/signal processing. More specifically, this lab is based on this [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/tutorials/speech_recognition_pipeline_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-speech-recognition-pipeline-tutorial-py), which you are encouraged to check.\n",
